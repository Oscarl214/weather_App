# Weather App

Simple weather application that allows a user to search for a city of their choice to be able to receive the current weather and a five day forecast. 

## Features

Provides current and future forecast for a given city using data from OpenWeather API

Search history is saved locally to display a dynamically updated list of recent cities

## Reflection

Fetching from the open weather API allowed me to understand the build in fetch method in js. 

## Resources Used

jQuery,
BootStrap, DayJS, OpenWeatherAPI
